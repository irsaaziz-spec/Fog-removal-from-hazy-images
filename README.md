Overview and Motivation:
This project aims to develop an image enhancement framework that removes fog and haze from degraded images to improve object detection accuracy. The proposed approach will integrate an image dehazing algorithm as a preprocessing step before object detection using a model such as YOLO.
Jetson Nano Suitability: Jetson Nano efficiently runs lightweight object detection models and can also handle classical or deep-learning-based image enhancement algorithms.
We have started with CAP (fast classical) to lock in a working improvement curve then if time allows we will add a tiny DL dehazer and compare.
