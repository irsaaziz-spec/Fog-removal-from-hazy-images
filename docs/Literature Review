Recent Developments in Image Dehazing and Fog Removal for Object Detection 
1. Introduction 
Haze and fog, caused by light scattering in the atmosphere, significantly degrade image quality and impair 
the performance of vision-based systems such as object detection. Recent research has focused on 
improving dehazing algorithms, not only to restore visual quality but also to enhance downstream tasks 
such as detection and segmentation. This chapter reviews major advancements from top-tier 
venues—CVPR, ICCV, and NeurIPS—between 2020 and 2024, highlighting how modern dehazing 
approaches affect detection accuracy in hazy conditions [1–3]. 
2. Classical Deep-Learning Dehazing Methods 
Classical CNN-based models estimate transmission and atmospheric light using encoder–decoder 
architectures. Morales et al. [4] proposed an efficient multi-scale U-Net (FastNet) achieving 
PSNR≈30.4 dB on NYU-Depth and PSNR≈22.1 dB on O-HAZE. These models improved restoration 
while maintaining real-time efficiency, crucial for autonomous systems. 
3. Transformer-Based Dehazing Models 
Recent methods employ Transformers for global context modeling. Guo et al. [5] introduced 
DehazeFormer (CVPR 2022), which embeds transmission-aware 3D positional encoding. Qiu et al. [6] 
presented MB-TaylorFormer (ICCV 2023), achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM with linear 
computational complexity. 
4. Physics-Informed and Hybrid Models 
Xie et al. [7] proposed SynFog (CVPR 2024), a photo-realistic synthetic fog dataset generated via 
end-to-end rendering. SynFog-trained models yielded higher PSNR (15.43 dB) and SSIM (0.612) on real 
fog, and improved YOLOv8 detection mAP (71.5%) compared to models trained on Foggy Cityscapes 
(69.7%). 
5. Joint Dehazing–Detection Pipelines 
Joint pipelines optimize dehazing and detection simultaneously. Zhang et al. [8] developed UDnD (ACCV 
2020) with a haze-density classifier guiding both networks. AlHindaassi et al. [9] proposed 
ADAM-Dehaze (2025), which improves PSNR by +2.1 dB and detection mAP by +13 points over 
baselines. 
6. Benchmark Datasets and Metrics 
Common datasets include RESIDE, DNH-HAZE, SynFog, and Foggy Cityscapes. Metrics like PSNR, 
SSIM, and mAP evaluate image restoration and detection quality [7,9]. SynFog’s physically-based 
rendering pipeline reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real fog images.
